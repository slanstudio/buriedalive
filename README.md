## Instructions
Try to reach to the top and escape getting buried alive. Touch on the right and left side of screen to move and climb up materials.   Avoid being squashed by falling bricks of rock, clay and sand and stacking them into steps that you can use to climb out of the hole. Each type of materials acts differently when it lands.
